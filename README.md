## Programming Environment

  * Python 3.8
  * Tensorflow 2.4.0
  * Numpy 1.19.5

## Datasets Preparation 

the bearing and gear fault datasets are collected from [Case Western Reserve University bearing data center](https://github.com/cathysiyu/Mechanical-datasets), [gear vibration dataset of University of Connecticut](https://figshare.com/articles/Gear_Fault_Data/6127874/1). 

| Health states of bearing | Health states of gear |
| ------------------------ | --------------------- |
| Normal                   | Chipping 1 (High)     |
| Inner race 0.007         | Chipping 3 (Middle)   |
| Inner race 0.0021        | Chipping 5 (Low)      |
| Outer race 0.007         | Crack                 |
| Outer race 0.014         | Missing               |
| Outer race 0.021         | Spalling              |
| Rolling element 0.014    | Healthy               |


In this paper, a signal-to-image conversion method [50] is used to transform the original 1D vibration signals into 2D gray images. code: signal-to-image conversion

## How to use

Before begin, please separate the training data of different health states into folders in folder`gray_images\\`. 
The code for training MACGAN and generate gray images is`training and generating.py`, you may also customize the parameters in config part in `training and generating.py`. The generated images will be saved in folder`generated images\\`.
